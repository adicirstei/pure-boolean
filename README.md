# DrBoolean (Brian Lonsdorf) rules

Brian Lonsdorf have an amazingly entertaining, instructive and free course on egghead.io:

[Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript)

I enjoyed it so much that I want to create the simple app he built at the end in [Purescript](http://purescript.org). The problem is my purescript is extremely poor :-).

This repo is an atempt in doing that.
